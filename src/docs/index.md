Commander to be fun for everyone, but it's very easy to have a poor
experience when you play with strangers, or even in your regular play group.
This site wants you to enjoy every commander game you play. To
that end we publish a short [checklist](checklist.md) to prompt discussion
before you start a commander game, so that all players have a common
understanding of what [philosophy](format/philosophy.md), play style, and desires
they are each bringing to the game.

We publish [guidelines on deck construction](opinion/guidelines.md), to help
new players get started with building their first decks.

And in future we might provide some more resources.
