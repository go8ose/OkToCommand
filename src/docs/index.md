OtC is a small community that wants commander to be fun for everyone. To
that end we publish a short [checklist](checklist.md) to prompt discussion
before you start a commander game, so that all players have a common
understanding of what [philosophy](philosophy.md), play style, and desires
they are each bringing to the game.

This version of the social commander manifest was published on 2019-08-18.
