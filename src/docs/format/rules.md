The official commander rules are maintained [over here](http://www.mtgcommander.net/rules.php)

But to summarise, when you are playing Commande you are playing a normal
game of magic, as described in detail in the [Comprehensive Rules](https://blogs.magicjudges.org/rules/cr/).
However there are some things that are unique to Commander that you might
not have seen in your other MTG play.

# Multiplayer

Commander can be played with just 2 players (and it's heaps of fun, give it
a go). But most Commander games are going to have more than that. 4 players
is perhaps the optimal number, 


## Large games
You can play much larger games as well, and they can be great fun. But as 
with many things, this quickly turns into a trade off. As you add player you
make games take much longer. You have a much larger wait time in-between your
turns. It's further to see the cards in front of the most distant player, so
it gets much harder to keep track of the current board state.


# Command Zone
As well as the normal zones in a MTG game (by that we mean the battlefield,
each players library, their hands, their graveyards, the exile zone and the
stack) there is an extra zone. It's called the Command Zone.

When you start a Commander game your Commander(s) start in the Command zone.
You can cast them from there, as if it was a card in your hand. If your
commander ever leaves the battle field (for any reason) you can choose to
put the commander back into the Command Zone, and cast it again later.

# Commander Tax
The Command Zone helps you drive down the variance in a magic game. You
always know what your commander can do, and you always have access to your
commander. In fact, it is too good to be true. To provide some balance to
that there is also a commander tax.

Each time you cast your commander from the command zone it costs 2 generic
mana extra from the last time.

On your first cast, you pay the casting cost printed on the card. If the
commander dies, and you return it to your command zone, you can then cast it
again for the printed casting cost plus 2 generic mana. The next time it
will cost you 4 generic mana, etc.

However that's only for casting from the Command Zone. If you get your
commander into your hand some how (perhaps by casting Unsummon on it), you
pay the normal printed casting cost.

# Commander Damage

There is a new way to loose/win the game. If a commander deals 21 damage to
an opponent, that opponent looses the game. This damage is tracked per
commander, and against specific players.  So if Alice steals your commander,
and does 21 damage to you with your own commander, you loose the game.
