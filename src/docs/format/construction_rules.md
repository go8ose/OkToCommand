The official commander rules are maintained [over here](http://www.mtgcommander.net/rules.php)

But to summarise the requirements on how you build your deck, your commander deck must conform to:

- have 1 commander (or two if both commanders have the partner keyword printed on them)
- have exactly 100 cards, including the commander(s)
- the commander must be a legendary creature, or a planeswalker with text that says it can be your commander (such as Aminatou, the Fateshifter)
- have cards that match the colour identity of your commander
- have only a single copy of each card, except
  - you can have multiple copies of basic lands
  - you may have multiple copies of cards that have printer on them rules text that says you may do that (such as Shadowborn Apostle)
- Commander allows vintage legal cards, and cards are legal to play as of
  their sets prerelease.
- There is a ban list, see [Bans](/format/bans)
