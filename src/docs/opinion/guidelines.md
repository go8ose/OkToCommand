For the specific requirements on what your deck must or must not do, please
see the article on [deck construction rules](/format/construction_rules).
Here are some general guidelines for constructing a commander deck. Not
every deck will match these ideas, and it's fine to experiment. But the
nature of the "format" (the rules, and the card pool available) means that
frequently these guidelines make decks that perform well. 

-  need > 30 cards (according to command zone) to support a theme, review http://www.metamox.com/tag/ to see if they have a tag that corresponds to the theme
- need about 6-10 sources of Ramp (according to command zone). Commanders brew likes about 5 mana rocks, and 5 other ramp sources, and have good low curve on their cost (so 5 to 6 cmc on ramp is to high). See http://www.metamox.com/tag/ramp/
- need 6-10 sources of Card Draw (according to command zone). Commanders brew like 2 big draw spells and 5 to 6 little draw spells. Often using draw for mana sink. There are different types (repeatable, mana free). See http://www.metamox.com/tag/draw/
- ~5 targeted removal (according to command zone). Commanders brew distinguishes between creature removal and artifact/enchantment removal. They like about 4 or even 5 artifact and/or enchantment removal. Commanders brew like about 3 spot creature removal. See http://www.metamox.com/tag/removal/
- ~5 board wipes (according to command zone). Commanders brew likes about 3 wraths. See http://www.metamox.com/tag/board-wipes/
- commanders brew run 0 or 1 tutors. They don't like the reduction in variance that tutors cause. They think variance is fun.

But even the above is very loose guidance. If this site is well received, we will in future provide decklist walk throughs, and commander theory articles.
