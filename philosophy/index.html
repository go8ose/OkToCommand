<h1 id="the-philosophy-of-commander">The Philosophy of Commander</h1>
<p><em>Commander is for fun</em>. It’s a socially interactive, multiplayer Magic: the
Gathering format full of wild interactions and epic plays, specifically
designed as an alternative to tournament Magic. As is fitting for a format
in which you choose an avatar to lead your forces into battle, Commander
focuses on a <em>resonant experience</em>. Each game is a journey the players
share, relying on a <em>social contract</em> in which each player is considerate of the experiences of everyone involved--this promotes player interaction, inter-game variance, a variety of play styles, and a positive communal atmosphere. At the end of an ideal Commander game, someone will have won, but all participants will have had the opportunity to express themselves through their deck building and game play.</p>
<p>The rules of Commander are designed to maximize these experiences within a
game of Magic. The addition of a commander, larger life total, and deck
building restrictions <em>emphasize the format’s flavor</em>; they increase deck variance and add more opportunities for participation and expression.</p>
<p>The goal of the ban list is similar; <em>it does not seek to regulate
competitive play</em> or power level, which are decisions best left to
individual play groups. The ban list seeks to demonstrate which cards
threaten the positive player experience at the core of the format or prevent
players from reasonable self-expression. <em>The primary focus of the list is
on cards which are problematic because of their extreme consistency,
ubiquity, and/or ability to restrict others’ opportunities.</em></p>
<p>No single rule can establish criteria for a ban; there are many mitigating or exacerbating factors. Some cards will represent an extreme on a single axis; others are a confluence of multiple smaller issues. The following list isn’t exhaustive, nor is it a checklist, but it represents ways in which cards challenge the positive experiences players look for in commander games. It includes cards which easily or excessively</p>
<ul>
<li>Cause severe resource imbalances</li>
<li>Allow players to win out of nowhere</li>
<li>Prevent players from contributing to the game in a meaningful way.</li>
<li>Cause other players to feel they must play certain cards, even though they are also problematic.</li>
<li>Are very difficult for other players to interact with, especially if doing so requires dedicated, narrow responses when deck-building.</li>
<li>Interact poorly with the multiplayer nature of the format or the specific rules of Commander.</li>
<li>Lead to repetitive game play.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cards which are banned likely meet a few of these criteria in a significant way; not all cards which meet some of the criteria need to banned.</p>
<p><em>We prefer to be conservative</em> with what goes on or comes off the ban list. Commander players often become emotionally attached to their decks through play and personalization, and we value that experience highly. We only want to disrupt that bond when necessary.</p>
<p>Commander is designed to be a malleable format. We encourage groups to use
the rules and the ban list as a <em>baseline</em> to optimize their own experience.
This is not license for an individual to force their vision onto a play
group, but encouragement for players to <em>discuss their goals</em> and how the
rules might be adjusted to suit those goals. <em>The format can be broken; we
believe games are more fun if you don’t.</em></p></div>
