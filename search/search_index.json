These cards should not be played without prior agreement from the other players in the game, and may steer your playgroup to avoid other, similar cards.

It\u2019s a socially interactive, multiplayer Magic: the Gathering format full of wild interactions and epic plays, specifically designed as an alternative to tournament Magic. As is fitting for a format in which you choose an avatar to lead your forces into battle, Commander focuses on a resonant experience . Each game is a journey the players share, relying on a social contract in which each player is considerate of the experiences of everyone involved--this promotes player interaction, inter-game variance, a variety of play styles, and a positive communal atmosphere. At the end of an ideal Commander game, someone will have won, but all participants will have had the opportunity to express themselves through their deck building and game play. The rules of Commander are designed to maximize these experiences within a game of Magic. The addition of a commander, larger life total, and deck building restrictions emphasize the format\u2019s flavor ; they increase deck variance and add more opportunities for participation and expression. The goal of the ban list is similar; it does not seek to regulate competitive play or power level, which are decisions best left to individual play groups. The ban list seeks to demonstrate which cards threaten the positive player experience at the core of the format or prevent players from reasonable self-expression. The primary focus of the list is on cards which are problematic because of their extreme consistency, ubiquity, and/or ability to restrict others\u2019 opportunities. No single rule can establish criteria for a ban; there are many mitigating or exacerbating factors. Some cards will represent an extreme on a single axis; others are a confluence of multiple smaller issues. The following list isn\u2019t exhaustive, nor is it a checklist, but it represents ways in which cards challenge the positive experiences players look for in commander games. It includes cards which easily or excessively Cause severe resource imbalances Allow players to win out of nowhere Prevent players from contributing to the game in a meaningful way. Cause other players to feel they must play certain cards, even though they are also problematic. Are very difficult for other players to interact with, especially if doing so requires dedicated, narrow responses when deck-building. Interact poorly with the multiplayer nature of the format or the specific rules of Commander. Lead to repetitive game play. Cards which are banned likely meet a few of these criteria in a significant way; not all cards which meet some of the criteria need to banned. We prefer to be conservative with what goes on or comes off the ban list. Commander players often become emotionally attached to their decks through play and personalization, and we value that experience highly. We only want to disrupt that bond when necessary. Commander is designed to be a malleable format. We encourage groups to use the rules and the ban list as a baseline to optimize their own experience. This is not license for an individual to force their vision onto a play group, but encouragement for players to discuss their goals and how the rules might be adjusted to suit those goals. The format can be broken; we believe games are more fun if you don\u2019t.","title":"Philosophy"},{"location":"format/philosophy/#the-philosophy-of-commander","text":"Commander is for fun .

However there are some things that are unique to Commander that you might not have seen in your other MTG play. Multiplayer Commander can be played with just 2 players (and it's heaps of fun, give it a go). But most Commander games are going to have more than that. 4 players is perhaps the optimal number, Large games You can play much larger games as well, and they can be great fun. But as with many things, this quickly turns into a trade off. As you add player you make games take much longer. You have a much larger wait time in-between your turns. It's further to see the cards in front of the most distant player, so it gets much harder to keep track of the current board state. Command Zone As well as the normal zones in a MTG game (by that we mean the battlefield, each players library, their hands, their graveyards, the exile zone and the stack) there is an extra zone. It's called the Command Zone. When you start a Commander game your Commander(s) start in the Command zone. You can cast them from there, as if it was a card in your hand. If your commander ever leaves the battle field (for any reason) you can choose to put the commander back into the Command Zone, and cast it again later. Commander Tax The Command Zone helps you drive down the variance in a magic game. You always know what your commander can do, and you always have access to your commander. In fact, it is too good to be true. To provide some balance to that there is also a commander tax. Each time you cast your commander from the command zone it costs 2 generic mana extra from the last time. On your first cast, you pay the casting cost printed on the card. If the commander dies, and you return it to your command zone, you can then cast it again for the printed casting cost plus 2 generic mana. The next time it will cost you 4 generic mana, etc. However that's only for casting from the Command Zone. If you get your commander into your hand some how (perhaps by casting Unsummon on it), you pay the normal printed casting cost. Commander Damage There is a new way to loose/win the game. If a commander deals 21 damage to an opponent, that opponent looses the game. This damage is tracked per commander, and against specific players. So if Alice steals your commander, and does 21 damage to you with your own commander, you loose the game.","title":"Play Rules"},{"location":"format/rules/#multiplayer","text":"Commander can be played with just 2 players (and it's heaps of fun, give it a go).

Here are some general guidelines for constructing a commander deck. Not every deck will match these ideas, and it's fine to experiment. But the nature of the \"format\" (the rules, and the card pool available) means that frequently these guidelines make decks that perform well. need > 30 cards (according to command zone) to support a theme, review http://www.metamox.com/tag/ to see if they have a tag that corresponds to the theme need about 6-10 sources of Ramp (according to command zone). Commanders brew likes about 5 mana rocks, and 5 other ramp sources, and have good low curve on their cost (so 5 to 6 cmc on ramp is to high). See http://www.metamox.com/tag/ramp/ need 6-10 sources of Card Draw (according to command zone). Commanders brew like 2 big draw spells and 5 to 6 little draw spells. Often using draw for mana sink. There are different types (repeatable, mana free). See http://www.metamox.com/tag/draw/ ~5 targeted removal (according to command zone). Commanders brew distinguishes between creature removal and artifact/enchantment removal. They like about 4 or even 5 artifact and/or enchantment removal. Commanders brew like about 3 spot creature removal. See http://www.metamox.com/tag/removal/ ~5 board wipes (according to command zone). Commanders brew likes about 3 wraths. See http://www.metamox.com/tag/board-wipes/ commanders brew run 0 or 1 tutors. They don't like the reduction in variance that tutors cause. They think variance is fun. But even the above is very loose guidance. If this site is well received, we will in future provide decklist walk throughs, and commander theory articles.","title":"Deck Guidelines"}]}
